        <h3>A Description of the Target Audience</h3>
        <p>
          Kairosview's main audience are people who live near Preston, Soda
          Springs, and Fish Haven Idaho. These rural communities experience a
          broad range of weather extremes throughout the year. Our target
          audience are users who want to make decisions based on our weather
          forcasts. Judging from the demographics of the towns mentioned.
          Farmers and ranchers could use our site to plan their work for the
          comming week.

      <div class="personas">
        <h4>Persona 1</h4>
        <p>
          The "Stay at Home Mom". The demographics from the community, show that
          the local woman's number one occupation is that of homemakers. This
          means that the mother decides and plans activities for her children to
          do throughout the day. They will use this site in order to get a good
          idea on how to dress herself and her children, the activites that they
          will do outdoors, and any accessories that they will need to bring
          with them.
        </p>
        <h4>Persona 2</h4>
        <p>
          The "Weekend Warrior". Like most rural communities, people spend a
          good portion of freetime outdoors. Camping, fishing, sports, and
          family activities are common activites for a typical Friday night. We
          need to build our site so that it is functional, easy to use, and
          updates the weather regularly
