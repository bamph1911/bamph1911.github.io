        <h3>Rule of Thirds</h3>
        <a href="url">https://www.vans.com/</a>

        <p>
          On March 16, 1966, in Anaheim, California. Brothers Paul and James Van
          Doren, opened up a small shoe store known as "The Van Doren Rubber
          Company". That opening day, they sold 12 pairs of shoes. Little did
          they know that their deck shoes, known simply as the "Authentic",
          would eventually be the sole of the worldwide company known as "VANS".
          <br />
          They would eventually find their niche in the blossoming California
          culture of Skateboarding. This new territory led them to design the
          first ever shoe made specifically for Skateboarding, the "Vans Sk8-Hi"
          in 1978.<br />
          We see that the placement of the shoe, follows the design principle
          known as "The Rule of Thirds". This design principle pulls the users
          eyes to the unique but iconic silhouette of the Sk8-Hi. What is not
          captured in the mobile screenshot, is the animation of the shoe
          changing colors. Even without the added attention grabber, because of
          the use of The Law of Thirds, customers see the shoe before they ever
          see the skateboarders in the background.

      <div class="contrast">
        <h3>Contrast</h3>
        <a href="url">https://www.urbanears.com/us/en/</a>

          Urbanears is an audio lifestyle brand located in Stockholm Sweden.
          Driven by progressive and minimalist design principles, Urbanears has
          created a eccentric brand of headphones and speakers. These
          aesthetically clean and user friendly devices stand out because of
          Urbanears unique selling proposition: COLOR.<br />
          Urbanear's flare for design is carried over in their web page layout.
          Here we see the use of the design principle called "Contrast".
          Contrast is used to show the distinct difference between the
          foreground and background colors, in order to enhance readability. In
          the screenshot, the similar warm maroon tones of the product, the
          model's hair, and the background color, contrast with the white text.
          In this case, the use of contrast not only makes the page readable,
          but highlights the core message of Urbanears.
          <i>Color should be loud.</i>

      <div class="repetition">
        <h3>Repetition</h3>
        <a href="url">https://www.ikea.com/us/en/</a>

        <p>
          Ikea is synonymous with swedish design. Furniture focused on the
          ideals of simplistic minilmalism, uniformity, and eco friendly
          materials. These nordic tenets are infused into Ikea's whole business
          model. From their office chairs, to their bedroom sets, even down to
          the very layout of their retail stores.<br />
          The Ikea web page also echoes these aesthetics. Here we see the design
          principle know as "Repetition". Repetition is used to create a feeling
          of clarity, unity, and cohesiveness. In the webpage we see the pattern
          of: 1.) icon 2.) heading 3.) single sentence 4.) learn more link,
          repeated 4 times. As we look at this example, we can clearly see a
          swedish minimalistic approach using Repition to answer the user's
          questions. Now if only they will tell us what they put in those
          meatballs.
